LocalAI act as a drop-in replacement REST API that‚Äôs compatible with OpenAI API specifications for local inferencing. It allows you to run LLMs, generate images, audio (and not only) locally or on-prem with consumer grade hardware, supporting multiple model families and architectures. Does not require GPU. It is created and maintained by `Ettore Di Giacinto`.\n",
